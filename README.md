# Preparing

Please follow the `/SWA-SOP/swasop/third_party/SparseTransformer/README.md`

# Running
All the scripts is controlled by the `/SWA-SOP/swasop/config/semantic_kitti.yaml`

## Training
```
python train.py --config path/to/config/semantic_kitti/
```

## Evaluation
- [Download the trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GauUHjrEQu6LMY1YlunbB0UJ77hXb33J/view?usp=sharing) and place the checkpoint file under `/path/to/kitti/logdir/trained_models/kitti.ckpt`.  
- Then update the ```resume``` path in ```config/semantic_kitti/``` accordingly.  
- The testing script can be found in the `third_party` folder.
